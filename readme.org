#+TITLE: Linear Regression
#+AUTHOR: Sven Hluchy

This program computes the simple linear regression (1) for a set of
data points of the form $(x, y)$.

More accurately, the program computes a linear function of the form $y=ax+b$ by using the following formula:

The program works as follows:

Suppose you have a dataset saved in a Lisp file, for example like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC Lisp
  ;;; data.lisp
  ((5 3) (4 3) (3 2) (1 3) (4 6) (2 1))
#+END_SRC

then you can call =(linear-regression (load-data "data.lisp"))= to
receive the output of the program. For this example, the output would
be =#(0.4615383 1.5384617)=.

In the future, I might add some form of plotting the linear regression
and it's corresponding dataset.

Huge thanks to Richard Behiel (2) for making a video on the topic (3),
which inspired me to make this program. I highly recommend checking
out their channel.
